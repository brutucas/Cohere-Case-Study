#### What are the origins of the idea behind this company?

    "Starting Cohere, Nick, Ivan, and I... the whole objective was to bring this tech, large language models [LLMS] to industry; bring it to the world, and facilitate adoption. Nobody really knew what large language models were, it was a research project, interesting tech, but no real commercial application. But I think we had conviction on the trajectory and the pace of progress and that computers would get increasingly good at manipulating language and we would quite soon arrive at a place where computers could speak our language... and that that would be increasingly valuable for the world." (Aidan Gomez)

The idea for Cohere emerged from the three co-founders’ work and research in natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. Gomez co-authored the groundbreaking Transformer paper called “Attention is All You Need” in 2017, which has become foundational to modern NLP advancements. He founded Cohere with Frosst, also a researcher at Google Brain, along with Zhang, with whom he had done research at FOR.ai. 

The fundamental idea behind Cohere is to “build a future without a language barrier between machines and humans.” Gomez, Frosst, and Zhang saw an opportunity to make the benefits of these powerful language models accessible to a broader audience. They wanted to make a tool that helps machines understand and use human language better. The founders aimed to connect cutting-edge NLP research and practical real world application, specifically for businesses and developers.

#### How is the company funded? How much funding has the company received? 

Mostly through venture capital. Cohere secured a significant amount in funding over several rounds from investors, including big names like Geoffrey Hinton and Fei-Fei Li. In May 2023, Cohere raised 270 million dollars, reaching a 2.1 billion dollar value. By July, SAP also invested an undisclosed sum into the business as part of its AI startup investments. In August, Tiger Global sold a 2.1% stake in Cohere for 63 million dollars, indicating a rise in Cohere's value to 3 billion dollars. There have been discussions about Cohere raising funding at a valuation of more than 6 billion, indicating a significant increase in the company's valuation and investor interest​​.

## Business Activities

#### What specific problem is this company trying to solve? 

Cohere is tackling the challenge of making natural language understanding and generation more accessible and efficient for businesses. This company is making it easier for businesses and developers to incorporate NLP technology into their products and services. In other words, Cohere helps all types of businesses to use advanced language understanding in their apps and products, such as chatbots or writing tools.

Cohere trains AI to digest text from an enterprises' internal data or publicly available sources, e.g. the internet, to understand how to process and respond to prompts with increasing sophistication.

Through this work, Cohere aims to democratize AI by providing easy-to-use NLP tools that can be integrated into various applications, such as customer service chatbots, search engines, copywriting, summarization, language-based content creation tools, and cash flow analysis. 

The company website divides these tools into the following categories: 
- Generate: write product descriptions, blog posts, articles, and marketing copy with scalable, affordable generative AI tools.
- Summarize: extract concise, accurate summaries of articles, emails, and documents.
- Neural search: build accurate, high-performance semantic text search across any document type in English or 100+ languages.
- Classify: run text classification for customer support routing, intent recognition, sentiment analysis, and more.
- Embed: access a managed embedding model that outperforms Open Source Software (OSS) and works in both English and 100+ languages to develop your own capabilities.

Here is an extensive list of example uses.

#### Who is the company’s intended customer? 
#### Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Cohere targets companies looking for an independent AI platform. Its intended customers span a broad range, including tech startups, large enterprises, and developers. The company aims to help businesses of any size, which are looking to incorporate NLP into their products or services. 

"We know the market will need an independent platform, not tied to any of the hyperscalers, to enable enterprises to adopt this technology in a way that is extremely data-private and secure."

I have not been able to find any specific information about the market size customers for Cohere, however the company is working in the rapidly-expanding NLP segment of the AI industry. Recent forecasts have projected the global NLP market to reach tens of billions of dollars in the coming years. I imagine that Cohere, with its focus on making NLP technology accessible and easy to use, is well-positioned to tap into this expanding global market.

#### What ‘unfair advantage’ is utilized by this company as compared to other competitors?

Cohere makes it very easy for ‘laymen’ (people who are not experts in AI) to use language AI. Their unfair advantage lies in its cutting-edge language models, which are both powerful and easy to integrate. The company focuses on simplicity and usability, which allows customers without deep technical expertise in AI to leverage and benefit from advanced NLP features. What sets Cohere apart from their competitors? A user-friendly approach, combined with advanced technology.

#### Which technologies is the company currently using? How are they implementing them? 

Cohere utilizes the latest advancements in machine learning and deep learning, specifically transformer-based models for processing and understanding natural language. The company offers Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that enable businesses to integrate various NLP functionalities into their applications. Cohere's platform is cloud-based, offering scalable and flexible NLP services to its users.

## Landscape

#### What domain or industry is the company in? 

Cohere is a company operating in the AI sector with a specific focus on NLP to generate, analyze, and understand text using machine learning.

#### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

The first major trend has been the rise of Transformer Models (unfortunately, Optimus Prime remains a cool toy). With the introduction of Chat-GPT, for example, the standards for language understanding and generation capabilities have risen, such that NLP has advanced to the point that AI can understand and generate human-like text.

The second trend has been increased accessibility, particularly when NLP technology is combined with cloud-based services. Tools and platforms like Cohere and Hugging Face have ‘democratized’ cutting-edge NLP models, making them more accessible to developers and businesses.

The third trend has been applications beyond text. NLP technologies are now being deployed in ‘mainstream’ business and culture, for example through art and music generation, voice assistants, and chatbots. There is a growing awareness in society of the multifunctional use of NLP, such that even teachers and waitresses have an opinion to share on ChatGPT.

The fourth trend has been multilingual expansion outside of the Anglosphere to make NLP technologies available for a broader range of languages, including those designated ‘low-resource’, which are traditionally underrepresented in NLP research.

#### What are the other major companies in this domain?

OpenAI - Chat-GPT
Google Brain - Bard 
IBM - Watson
Meta - Llama 2
Stability AI - Stability Diffusion / LM
Anthropic - various LLM models

## Results

#### What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Cohere has made strides in making NLP technologies accessible for businesses, enabling them to integrate advanced language models into their applications and services without the need for expert AI knowledge. 

Cohere announced a partnership with Google Cloud in November 2021, when it also launched it’s API. By February 2022, Cohere had seen a usage increase of 800%. In June 2023, Cohere announced a partnership with Oracle to make use of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to create its LLMs. In the following month, Cohere made a deal with McKinsey for the consulting firm to provide Cohere’s generative AI services to client businesses.

#### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? 

- *Model accuracy and performance* : How good are their AI models? Can the AI - understand and respond to language tasks correctly? (e.g. Language translation, Sentiment analysis)
- *Adoption rate* : How many businesses and developers are using their service (e.g. Number of active users, API calls, Product integration)
- *Customer satisfaction* :  How effectively do Cohere’s products meet user needs? (e.g. User feedback, Retention rates, Case studies of successful implementation)
- *Scalability* : How well can the company handle more work? Do their AI services have the ability to handle increasing volumes of data and requests without performance degradation?

#### How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

The company website offers numerous case studies of successful implementation, as well as clear, visual demonstrations of the technology’s applications for example business and developer needs. Exact performance figures are proprietary, but it appears that Cohere is continuing to find more customers and make them happy with increasingly more accessible NLP technology.

#### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

It is difficult to find any specific information regarding growth in valuation, profits, and investment for Cohere, as it is a private company and not publicly-traded. According to comments made by the CEO of Hugging Face, recent chaos with Sam Altman at OpenAI has certainly given a boost to companies like Cohere.

Cohere's focus on user-friendly API and model accessibility for non-experts in the business world positions it uniquely, and possibly leading, in ease of integration and developer satisfaction. I have not been able to find any data on performance comparisons between Cohere’s AI services and those of competitors.

## Recommendations

#### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?

The CEO, Aidan Gomez, appears to recognise the existing potential for AI application, as well as the potential growth in the business adoption of LLMs.

    "We're still early... the world looks very different two years from now and this technology is a feature of every single product that we interact with. It just becomes day-to-day, it just becomes an expectation. You expect to talk to an agent that is automated and as smart as a human."

If Gomez is correct and this world comes into being, I would make the following suggestions for Cohere to capitalize on the extremely high demand for its products:

- *Human-Agent Interaction* : Cohere’s language models must offer seamless human-computer interaction. Is it possible for generative AI to become indistinguishable in intelligence from a human? This would continue to fuel the adoption of LLMs.

- *Understanding Unstructured Data* : if analyst estimates are correct, almost 90% of data is unstructured and is difficult to analyze, as it lacks a consistent data model. I would recommend that Cohere utilize NLP to unlock the insights of such a vast amount of unstructured data.

- *Customizable AI Models* : connected to the previous point, Cohere could offer users the ability (either through a product or personnel training) to train models on their data, providing NLPs that are tailored to their unique business needs.

- *Computer Vision* : if Cohere could develop a “visual grounding system for language” through multimodal language models, there exists the potential for improved existing LLMs and additional standalone products. A quick search reveals that the computer vision market is expected to more than quadruple by 2030 - another opportunity that Cohere would be foolish to ignore.

The preceding suggestions leverage Cohere’s strengths in NLP and offer scalable, personalized solutions to business, which can be adapted to the needs of specific industries. All in all, Cohere appears well-positioned to solidify and expand its position as a leader in customizable, accessible, and AI-driven language processing.
