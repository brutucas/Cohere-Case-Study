#### What are the origins of the idea behind this company?

    "Starting Cohere, Nick, Ivan, and I... the whole objective was to bring this tech, large language models [LLMS] to industry; bring it to the world, and facilitate adoption. Nobody really knew what large language models were, it was a research project, interesting tech, but no real commercial application. But I think we had conviction on the trajectory and the pace of progress and that computers would get increasingly good at manipulating language and we would quite soon arrive at a place where computers could speak our language... and that that would be increasingly valuable for the world." (Aidan Gomez)

The idea for Cohere emerged from the three co-founders’ work and research in natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. Gomez co-authored the groundbreaking Transformer paper called “Attention is All You Need” in 2017, which has become foundational to modern NLP advancements. He founded Cohere with Frosst, also a researcher at Google Brain, along with Zhang, with whom he had done research at FOR.ai. 

The fundamental idea behind Cohere is to “build a future without a language barrier between machines and humans.” Gomez, Frosst, and Zhang saw an opportunity to make the benefits of these powerful language models accessible to a broader audience. They wanted to make a tool that helps machines understand and use human language better. The founders aimed to connect cutting-edge NLP research and practical real world application, specifically for businesses and developers.

Mostly through venture capital. Cohere secured a significant amount in funding over several rounds from investors, including big names like Geoffrey Hinton and Fei-Fei Li. In May 2023, Cohere raised 270 million dollars, reaching a 2.1 billion dollar value. By July, SAP also invested an undisclosed sum into the business as part of its AI startup investments. In August, Tiger Global sold a 2.1% stake in Cohere for 63 million dollars, indicating a rise in Cohere's value to 3 billion dollars. There have been discussions about Cohere raising funding at a valuation of more than 6 billion, indicating a significant increase in the company's valuation and investor interest​​.

## Business Activities

#### What specific problem is this company trying to solve? 

Cohere is tackling the challenge of making natural language understanding and generation more accessible and efficient for businesses. This company is making it easier for businesses and developers to incorporate NLP technology into their products and services. In other words, Cohere helps all types of businesses to use advanced language understanding in their apps and products, such as chatbots or writing tools.

Cohere trains AI to digest text from an enterprises' internal data or publicly available sources, e.g. the internet, to understand how to process and respond to prompts with increasing sophistication.

Through this work, Cohere aims to democratize AI by providing easy-to-use NLP tools that can be integrated into various applications, such as customer service chatbots, search engines, copywriting, summarization, language-based content creation tools, and cash flow analysis. 

The company website divides these tools into the following categories: 
- Generate: write product descriptions, blog posts, articles, and marketing copy with scalable, affordable generative AI tools.
- Summarize: extract concise, accurate summaries of articles, emails, and documents.
- Neural search: build accurate, high-performance semantic text search across any document type in English or 100+ languages.
- Classify: run text classification for customer support routing, intent recognition, sentiment analysis, and more.
- Embed: access a managed embedding model that outperforms Open Source Software (OSS) and works in both English and 100+ languages to develop your own capabilities.

Here is an extensive list of example uses.

#### Who is the company’s intended customer? 
#### Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Cohere targets companies looking for an independent AI platform. Its intended customers span a broad range, including tech startups, large enterprises, and developers. The company aims to help businesses of any size, which are looking to incorporate NLP into their products or services. 

"We know the market will need an independent platform, not tied to any of the hyperscalers, to enable enterprises to adopt this technology in a way that is extremely data-private and secure."

I have not been able to find any specific information about the market size customers for Cohere, however the company is working in the rapidly-expanding NLP segment of the AI industry. Recent forecasts have projected the global NLP market to reach tens of billions of dollars in the coming years. I imagine that Cohere, with its focus on making NLP technology accessible and easy to use, is well-positioned to tap into this expanding global market.

#### What ‘unfair advantage’ is utilized by this company as compared to other competitors?

Cohere makes it very easy for ‘laymen’ (people who are not experts in AI) to use language AI. Their unfair advantage lies in its cutting-edge language models, which are both powerful and easy to integrate. The company focuses on simplicity and usability, which allows customers without deep technical expertise in AI to leverage and benefit from advanced NLP features. What sets Cohere apart from their competitors? A user-friendly approach, combined with advanced technology.

Which technologies is the company currently using? How are they implementing them? 

Cohere utilizes the latest advancements in machine learning and deep learning, specifically transformer-based models for processing and understanding natural language. The company offers Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that enable businesses to integrate various NLP functionalities into their applications. Cohere's platform is cloud-based, offering scalable and flexible NLP services to its users.
